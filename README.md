## Hi, I'm Laxman 👋🏼

**Data Science Student** From Illinois Tech | Learning one dataset at a time 📚

Passionate about data, slightly obsessed with clean datasets (do they exist?).

- 🌱 Currently learning: Why my neural network thinks everything is a hot dog
- 💻 Working on: Projects that sounded simpler in my head
- 📊 Fun fact: I've cleaned more data than I've analyzed
- 🎯 Goal: Build something that doesn't overfit for once
